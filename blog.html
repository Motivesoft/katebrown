		<p>Confucius carried the iron candlestick to the mariners. They weeped, and 
basked on the macadam. Due to their stringiness, the mariners rebated confucius
with their floppiest cushioning for the turgidity. Altruistically karmic, the
tubed bandaged armful was obscurely healed, and with a tweezer removed the piece
of masonry and all was well again.

		<p>Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a strange word. I mean, really. It must be bad enough to be suffering with hypoparathyroidism, and then you find that in fact it is pseudohypoparathyroidism, and before you know it you've got the very serious diagnosis of pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. Funny old world. I'll have to go find out what it is! Is it as awful as pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis? Btw, I spelled that from memory, it's prolly totally wrong! Btw, I got hungry and ate all the big words in the dictionary for breakfast...

	Cats!!
	<br /><br />
	Talk about having nine lives.
	<br /><br />
	So we're in our favourite hang-out, let's give them a link:
	<a href="http://www.toyk.co.uk/">Toyk</a>,
	when someone passing noticed a miaowing coming from one of the guy's cars parked outside. It took a while to find it, but it seems
	that the cat had crawled up into the engine and got comfy, and the guy had driven it to work. How many lives
	the cat used up just by surviving the journey is amazing. It was now sitting under the car, scared and lost. With some ham and
	a cat-friendly passer-by, the cat was eventually pulled out from under the car and the guy drove it home. The vet was closed, so when
	he got it home he decided to make sure the cat was ok before letting it free. It was in his lap, curled up
	and purring, when...<br /><br />...it decided to make a dash for it, straight up the guy's chimney where it is now stuck!

	Back in Toyk.
	<br /><br />
	I've been off doing websites, just popping in for a quick update.
	<br /><br />
	American Sitcoms I watch too much of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Friends</li>
	<li>Frasier</li>
	<li>Scrubs</li>
	<li>Spin City</li>
	<li>Dharma and Greg</li>
	<li>Married With Children</li>
	<li>Everybody loves Raymond</li>
	<li>Two and a half Men</li>
	<li>King of Queens</li>
	<li>Just Shoot Me</li>
	<li>Andy Richter Controls the Universe</li>
	<li>The Trouble with Normal</li>
	<li>Will &amp; Grace</li>
	<li>Becker</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've just tried Stacked but it's just not that funny.
	<br />
	Some British sitcoms are funny, my complete favourite right now is The IT Crowd on
	Channel 4, which was just hilarious, and gets funny the more and more you watch it.

	Ian's birthday today. We don't do numbers any more, it's getting embarrassing. We both took the day off work, and
	spent the day doing what we love - shopping, drinking coffee, visiting wi-fi spots. For his birthday, I got him
	some noise-cancelling headphones and his own web domain. Tonight it's take-out for tea, probably chinese.
	<br /><br />
	Well done to everyone who found the single pixel link, shame on those of you who cheated!

	Mothering Sunday. Got some great cards from the kids, and chocolate, yum scrum :) Stephanie had made me her card,
	her artwork is fab, I'm going to put some of it up for people to admire. She drew the pic on my homepage.

	The morning after the night before. I'm back in the internet cafe, the music's playing. The cafe's playing the Cheeky Girls
	singing something or other, I've got 10CC with Dreadlock Holiday. Anyone older than they like to admit knows I made
	the right choice with the headphones :)
	<br /><br />
	Back to the blog. So, it's kind of like an online diary where I can put up anything I like, and if nobody wants to read
	it then it makes no odds, and probably no-one even wants to or will (except for the poor friends and relatives that get the URL
	texted or emailed to them so they'll have no choice. So a big hello to all my poor friends and relatives that got the
	URL shoved at them until they had no choice, and made it this far reading my blog! I love you all!!)
	<br /><br />
	Here's the Toyk Playlist on my Windows Media Player Library:
	<br /><br />
	10CC - Dreadlock Holiday<br />
	Bob Marley - No Woman No Cry (live)<br />
	Kings of Leon - Molly's Chambers<br />
	Green Day - American Idiot<br />
	Green Day - Holiday<br />
	Green Day - Boulevard Of Broken Dreams<br />
	Motorhead - Ace of Spades<br />
	The Boomtown Rats - Rat Trap<br />
	Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Scar Tissue<br />
	Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Californication<br />
	Wheatus - Teenage Dirtbag<br />
	Japan - Quiet Life<br />
	The Stranglers - Golden Brown<br />
	The Undertones - My Perfect Cousin<br />
	The Jam - Going Underground<br />
	Kula Shaker - Grateful when you're dead<br />
	<br />
	So it's not perfect yet, but it's good stuff and I like it.
	<br /><br />
	So really, I can put anything up here? Poor bandwidth, first there'll be photographs and pics and
	links to favourite websites, then recipe sections and I suppose there should be an 'about me'
	bit, hobbies, fave films, quotes etc., then I could try installing
	a chat area and, of course, there just has to be a guestbook! Live chat? Special Christmas CSS
	layout? Now there's an idea. Except we're not having christmas this year, we're having
	thanksgiving. We had Yule last year. There's only so many times you can enjoy sewing up a
	turkey and panicking over the presents and getting dragged around the shops for weeks
	by my mum who somehow has hers all bought and wrapped by December 1st and then there's
	picking the bluetak off the walls into
	February and finding tinsel everywhere and if it wasn't for the half ton of left-over cold roast potatoes
	in the fridge then it wouldn't be worth doing it at all. There's not much in the way of religion
	left in it, it's just Nintendo/Bond Film/Presents Day. Last year, we started a new tradition, Ian
	and I had the kids over earlier in December and then, christmas eve, we got on a plane to Gran
	Canaria. What a treat! We came back new year's eve, and landed back in London just as the fireworks
	were being set off at midnight. Fabulous. We're SO doing the same thing this year, but we can't
	decide where to go yet.
	<br /><br />
	We're having Thanksgiving because it's earlier than Christmas, but in food-terms only, we're
	english and therefore haven't got a clue about the real, first thanksgiving! But we watch far too
	many US sitcoms, and I have a hankering for baked yams with baby marshmallows, and gravy and
	biscuits and creamed corn and mash. The rest of the family is either horrified or bemused.
	<br /><br />
	I decided that there should be a link to my blog from my home page. Can you see it? Look closer!!
	<br /><br />
	Time:19.27: according to my laptop. Bottle of wine drunk, Irish coffee on the way. Will sleep well
	tonight! Choice: David Bowie with the Laughing Gnome, or boy band and soft jazz?
	<br /><br />
	Oh dear. Now it would seem that a blog has unique characteristics that set it apart
	from regular web pages. They invariably include a time stamp. And each entry also has its
	own Permalink, and sometimes a Trackback. I don't seem to have any of these, I apologise and hang my head in shame
	for the sloppiness of my blog. Somehow it's managing without them but believe me I will look
	them up as soon as. I also have to choose a blog provider. I seem to have not bothered with that
	bit either, hope it's not too much of a problem! Just basic ol' html, but it seems to be working out quite
	nicely thanks. Ian's quite excited by the idea of christmas.css though! Better keep the blasted thing
	out of a table then. Actually, it's going to be interesting (to me anyhoo) to see how it blossoms from a simple
	page into, well, whatever it is that blogs become. Large interactive websites for the masses? A humungous
	waste of bandwidth? I'll set the CSS garden on it, that might be fun. I needed something to use it on. Now I just
	have to write it. And just before that, I have to learn how to do it. But that's what the wi-fi and weekends are for!
	<br /><br />
	Time:21.34: Pizza's on the way, one kid playing on his Nintendo DS, another on her laptop chatting to her friends.
	Ian's on his laptop inventing a new web-browser, Firefox and IE just don't cut the mustard apparently!

	<div class="padded post">
		<p>
	Today I decided to start my blog. I've been avoiding it until now, to be honest I've been to busy to learn about blogging.
	Over to the recently-discovered Wikipedia. Nope, just too busy for that sort of thing. If I've got time to write a blog
	then I've got time to learn more css.
	<br /><br />
	But today, I saved a fly. At work. Poor thing was drowning in a jug of milk, and I fished it out of the bowl with a
	teaspoon. I put it on a serviette to dry out. It made me happy, watching it use it's back legs to dry off, I know it'll be
	good at it, and be just fine, because I had to save a few last year. This'll be the first of many this year, and as summer starts I'll be
	fishing them out like, er, sorry, flies! Sometimes you have to move them, very carefully, onto a dry bit. They don't
	like being blotted off. And as I was telling my
	husband this story, via skype chat, I decided that at last I had something to blog about. So here goes folks...
	<br /><br />
	Btw, Ian (the husband) is sitting two feet in front of me, in the cafe. We're skyping because I've got headphones on to drown
	out the music the cafe plays. Ooh, too mellow, can't bear it! I got a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, and to anyone
	that goes to cafes or on public transport or whatever, these things are worth every penny. Though please, think and surf
	before you buy!
	<br /><br />
	Ah, blogging. Half an hour after setting up the page I'm completely addicted and just have to add more. Oh, brb, my
	seafood laksa has arrived. Absolutely yummy. Perfect friday night, spicy seafood 'n' coconut, bottle of wine, internet,
	and the whole weekend ahead of me.
